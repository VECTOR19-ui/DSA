<h1>Array</h1>
<p>Array is a container which can hold fixed number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structure make use of array to implement their algorithms.</p>
<p>Generally arrays can be defined as An array is a data structure in computer programming that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. An array consists of a fixed number of elements and each element can be accessed using its index or position in the array. Arrays can be of one, two, or higher dimensions also known as one dimensional arrays, two dimensional arrays, or multi-dimensional arrays. One-dimensional arrays are also known as vectors or lists. The size of an array is usually fixed when it is created, but some programming languages support dynamic arrays that can be resized during program execution. Arrays are widely used in programming for storing and manipulating data such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or strings.</p>
